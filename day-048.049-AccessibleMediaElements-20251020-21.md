## 1. When Is the alt Attribute Needed, and What Are Some Examples of Good Alt Text?
Alt text is used 1) in images and 2)by search engines to understand images.
## 1.1 Best practices of `alt` text for images:
+ You should try to keep alt text short but should still be detailed enough to understand the image, but not so long at the same time that it becomes confusing.
  > Example: this is too short - "A puppy", "Resort".
+ You should not try to describe every little detail. Focus on the most important aspects of the image.
+ Generally, you don't need to start with "image of" or "picture of." You can just start the description directly.
+ Also, if there's similar text around the image, you don't need to write it again.
+ It's usually recommended to end the alt text with a period for consistency.
+ If the image is a link to another page, instead of describing the image itself, the alt text should describe what will happen if users click on it.
  > Instead of
  > ```
  > <a href="about.html">
  >   <img src="arrow-right.png" alt="Right arrow." />
  > </a>
  > ```
  > It should be something like
  > ```
  > <a href="about.html">
  >   <img src="arrow-right.png" alt="Go to next page." />
  > </a>
  > ```
+ every image needs to have an alt text attribute - even if image is decorative, the `alt` attribute should be empty i.e. `alt=""`, you need to have the attribute present in your HTML code.
  - having it so it can be ignored by screen readers
  - not having it at all will result in screen readers reading the image file name
  > Example: `<img src="decorative_image.jpg" alt="" />`

## 2. Good Link Text
Descriptive links help users know where they're headed and what they'll access. 

Here are some best practices to keep in mind while writing link texts:
+ Make sure links are visually distinct by using underlining and other visual cues, so users can easily identify and navigate them.
+ Avoid generic link texts like "here", "click here", and "more-info" as they don't provide any useful information.
+ Aim for concise and descriptive link texts, ideally between 2-5 words, that convey the link's purpose.
+ Avoid jargon and abbreviations that users may not understand.
+ Focus on the destination, not the action. For example, "user behavior results", instead of "click here to read more".
+ Don’t repeat the same link text for different destinations.
+ Place links in a way that they make sense within the surrounding text. For example, "for more details, visit our events page" instead of "Click here for more".

Bad and Good examples
| Bad Example | Why bad | Good Example | Why good |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<a href="webinar-details-link">Details</a>` | doesn’t provide specific information about what the user will find if they click the link | `<a href="webinar-details-link">Get details about our upcoming webinar</a>` | reduces ambiguity by specifying that the link is related to a webinar, making it easier to decide whether they want to click on it |
| `<a href="/blog-post-link">Read more</a>` | lacks context | `<a href="/blog-post-link">Read our latest blog post on web accessibility</a>` | clearer idea of what to expect and why they might want to click the link |
| `<a href="/link-to-topic">More info</a>` | It doesn't provide specific details about the link's destination | `<a href="/link-to-topic">Learn more about our accessibility efforts</a>` | clearly describes what the user will find if they click the link |

## 3. What Are Good Ways to Make Audio and Video Content Accessible?
A video is not just about visuals but also audio, so the first thing you should consider doing is adding captions or subtitles to your video content.
- Captions: provide the text version of spoken words and important non-verbal sounds, like music or laughter, synchronized with the video.
- Subtitles: are essential for people who don't understand the language you're speaking. This helps not only people who are deaf or hard of hearing but also those watching videos in noisy or quiet environments.
- Transcript: Unlike captions, transcripts don’t need to be synchronized with the media.
  - useful for deaf people and those hard of hearing
  - beneficial for people who prefer reading instead of watching or listening
  - make your content searchable, allowing users to quickly find specific parts of your audio or video
- Adding a sign language overlay for videos for deaf people and those hard of hearing.
- Providing volume and speed controls.
- Ensuring good contrast for on-screen text.
- Offering multiple formats.


You can add caption or subtitlesa using the `track` element inside your `video` or `audio` element:
```
    <video
      width="400"
      height="300"
      controls
      src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/labs/What is the map method and how does it work.mp4"
    >
      <track
        src="captions.vtt"
        kind="captions"
        srclang="en"
        label="English"
      />
    </video>

    <audio controls src="sample.mp3">
      <track
        src="captions.vtt"
        kind="captions"
        srclang="en"
        label="English"
      />
    </audio>
```
- `kind` attribute: values include `captions`, `subtitles`, `chapters` and `metadata`.
- `srclang` attribute: represents the language for the `track` content
- `label` attribute: a descriptive title for the text track that browsers use to identify and display it in the list of available text tracks.

Transcript - you can simply add the transcript below the audio or video:
```
<audio controls>
  <source src="audio.mp3" />
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

<!-- Transcript -->
<h3>Transcript</h3>
<p>
  [Speaker 1]: Welcome to the tutorial on making accessible content
</p>
<p>
  [Speaker 2]: Today, we'll cover captions, transcripts, and more.
</p>

<!-- Rest of transcript -->
```
- Platforms like YouTube or Vimeo have automatic captions and transcripts for videos. But if you're not satisfied, you can use services like veed.io, Rev, Amara, and Descript.

## 4. What Are Some Ways to Make Web Applications Keyboard Accessible?
### 4.1 the `Tab` key
Many users rely on the `Tab` key to move through interactive elements on a webpage. By default, browsers let users tab through elements like links, buttons, and form fields in the order they appear in the HTML. This is called the natural tab order.

### 4.2 `tabindex` attribute
Sometimes, you may want to adjust which elements are focusable or change their focus order. The `tabindex` attribute allows you do this.
- `tabindex="0"`: Adds the element to the natural tab order. For example:
  ```
  <button>First</button>
  <div tabindex="0">Second</div>
  <a href="#">Third</a>
  ```
- `tabindex="-1"`: Makes an element focusable programmatically. This is useful for managing focus in elements that are not normally focusable, such as headings, containers, dialogs, or error messages (more on that in JavaScript).
- `tabindex` greater than 0: Sets a custom tab order, so elements with lower positive values are focused first - tabbing will focus the input with tabindex="1" first, then 2, then 3, regardless of their order in the HTML:
  ```
  <input tabindex="2">
  <input tabindex="1">
  <input tabindex="3">
  ```
> This approach is discouraged because it can make navigation confusing and hard to maintain, especially as the page grows or changes.

### 4.3 `accesskey`
Another attribute you can use to make your web project keyboard accessible. It allows you to define a key that focuses on or activates a particular element:
```
<button accesskey="s">Save</button>
<button accesskey="c">Cancel</button>
<a href="index.html" accesskey="h">Home</a>
```
The exact key combination to activate the accesskey might vary depending on the browser and operating system. It's typically ALT + Specified Key on Windows and CTRL + Option + Specified Key on Mac.

### 4.4 Focus indicators
Another way to make the keyboard accessible in your apps is to make sure you provide clear focus indicators.
```
element:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #005fcc;
}
```
The `outline property` is used to define the outline around the element. This example sets the outline to a solid blue line with 2 pixels set for the thickness.
