# Day 28 - A Break

I know I said no break - but I've decided (after some hesitation) to apply for citizenship so spent some time in the evening while my wife is getting the baby to sleep.

The reason why I hesitated:\
I was just not sure of how to "identify" myself if I become a British citizen:
- Will I still be Chinese? Maybe not, maybe yes.
- Will I be British? Maybe not, maybe yes.
- Will I be not-Chinese? Probably not.
- Will I be not-British? Seems not either.
So who am I?

I guess at the end of the day, I'm a world citizen. And I can be both Chinese and British at the same time - not by law as China doesn't acknoledge dual citizenship, which means I'll give up my Chinese nationality when I gained my British citizenship.

And although Chinese passport is not that convenient/welcomed when it comes to travelling to other countries, I heard on the grapevine that one can find it very difficult to try to reclaim their Chinese nationality back.

At the end of the day, I think in my head it's always gonna be a "when" problem, less of a "join or not" question. So these policies is juts bringing my decision forward - I don't want to end up renewing every xx years and spending even more time and money to be able to stay with my family here in the UK (have spent enough!!).

The reason I decided to apply for citizenship now:\
- [Reform's potential new policy regarding ILR](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c930xypxpqpo)
- Then [Labor's ILR policy](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-reform-indefinite-leave-remain-immigration-b2836323.html) as a reaction to that

I shared this with a group of WeChat friends (where we share tips of applying for visas, and living in the UK etc.). Some tend to believe this is not likely going to happen as it's too aggressive, plus this will affect a lot more population. By comparison, the Spouse Visa changes, though also faced with challenges, involve a smaller population - and it still proceeded.

My reasoning behind this is simple: no matter how crazy some policies may seem, once it's announced, it will never go back. Sure there may be another party come into play, but what I've seen is they'll just "tweak" it, but will **NEVER** went back to what it was originally.

And you can see from Labor's reaction already. We're all sacrifices of political pleasing.
