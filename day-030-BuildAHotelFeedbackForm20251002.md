# Day 30: Workshop: Build a Hotel Feedback Form

## Key topics covered:
- [x] `label`
- [x] `input`
- [x] `fieldset`
- [x] legends
- [x] textareas
- [x] `button`


## To review and use 
Upon looking at the example, I can see
- that it has quite a few functions that haven't been covered
  - the sections where there is a reactangular box surrounding the text of that section (I guess similar to heading but different)
  - dropdown
  - freetext comment box that has specific height nad length
 - that I've forgotten about checkbox and the `checked` boolean attribute (though you can tell I do rememeber them, just not how to use them)

Anyway, I'll still follow my approach as usual i.e. do my coding in VS Code and then come back to this workshop - it will look bad/very far away from what it wants me to build

And here is what I come up with

## What didn't go well
1. Quite a few functions I haven't learnt yet
2. Forgot about checkbox and `checked` attribute
3. Although just learnt Forms in Day 28 and 29, the memory is not that fresh
   > As in, not super sure what the code should be like. Whereas for previous workshops I pretty much remember and almost sure what it should look like

## What did go well

## Suggestions
1. Why are we doing a workshop with functions that haven't been covered in the course so far?
2.
