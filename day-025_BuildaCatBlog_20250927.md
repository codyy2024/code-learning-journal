# Day 25: Workshop - Build a Cat Blog Page

## Key topics covered:
- [x] build an HTML only blog page
- [x] use semantic elements `main`, `nav`, `article` and `footer` elements

[Big question here: unless my my mempry is completely messed up, I don't think the last three have been covered in much detail. Maybe `footer` was covered specifically and a bit more than the others, but `nav` and `article` were only introduced as part of other topics/elements. So if I'm honest, I'm not that comfortable/confident about this workshop. But let's see.]

----

- Unsure really where `nav` lives: in the `head` element, or in the `main` element in `body`?
- Unsure about how to use `section` - I mean I know how to use the elements, just not 100% sure what the best practise/meaning behind this
- Unsure about the Phone, Email, and Address sections in the footer
- Good that I still have a good grasp of boiletplate and the usage of `figure` and the `img` and `figcaption` elements in it.
- Glad the `ul` nad `li` under it comes to life to me while I was writing the blog page outside of freeCodeCamp in Visual Studio Code, but unsure if it sits at the same level as `p`, or needs to sit under `p`
