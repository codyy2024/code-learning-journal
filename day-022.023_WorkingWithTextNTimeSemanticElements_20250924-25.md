## Key topics covered
- [x] Block and inline quotes in HTML
- [x] Display abbreviation in HTML
- [x] Display address in HTML
- [x] Display times and dates in HTML

## 1. How do block and inline quotes work in HTML? (Non-void elements)
- Use block quotes for extended quotations from other sources
- Use inline quotes for short quotations (a few words) from other sources that should be part of existing paragraphs

### 1.1 Block quotes `blockquote`
Example 1
- double quotation marks `"` added manually by **YOU** (not automatically added)
- `cite` attribute
  - URL behind the scene (does not show in browsaer);
  - helpful for giving screen readers and search engines more information about the quote
- indented
```
<blockquote cite="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/">
  "Can you imagine what it would be like to be a successful developer? To have built software systems that people rely upon?"
</blockquote>
```

Example 2: mutiple paragraphs (not adding quotation marks)
```
<blockquote cite="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/">
  <p>Build your projects. Show them to your friends. Build projects for your friends.</p>
  <p>Build your network. Help the people you meet along the way. What goes around comes around. You'll get what's coming to you.</p>   
  <p>It is not too late. Life is long.</p>
  <p>You will look back on this moment years from now and be glad you made a move.</p>
</blockquote>
```
Example 3: `cite` element inside `blockquote` element
- Mark up the title of a referenced creative work (boik, film etc.)
_**Q**: How is this different from `i` or `em`, visually?_
```
<div>
  <blockquote cite="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/">
    Can you imagine what it would be like to be a successful developer? To have built software systems that people rely upon?
  </blockquote>
  <p>â€”Quincy Larson, <cite>How to Learn to Code and Get a Developer Job [Full Book].</cite></p>
</div>
```

### 1.2 inline quote `q`
- Most modern browsers will add the double quotation marks automatically
- Quotes not indented but as parf of the paragraph
Example 1: 
```
<p>
  As Quincy Larson said,
  <q cite="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/">
    Momentum is everything.
  </q>
</p>
```

## 2. How do you display abbreviation in HTML?
Use the `abbr` element (non-void). There are two types of abbreviation:/
- Acronym: a **word** formed from the initial letters of a phrase, with each letter representing the first letter of a word in that phrase. Example: GUI = Graphical User Interface
- Initialisation:  formed from the initial letters of a phrase, with each letter representing the first letter of a word in that phrase.

The distinction is acronyms are pronounced as words and initialisms are pronounced as individual letters.

Example with just `abbr`:
```
<p><abbr>HTML</abbr> is the foundation of the web.</p>
```
- Helpful behind the scenes, but users see them as normal text.
<br>

Example with the `title` attribute inside the `abbr` opening tag to give more information/context
```
<p><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is the foundation of the web.</p>
```
- The `title` attribute is optional, but if you decide to include it, it must be a human readable description of the abbreviation.
- Usually, the style of the abbreviation element will change when you add this attribute.

In Chrome:\

***You should use your best judgment to find the right balance between information and presentation to avoid cluttering the text while being clear and concise.***

## 3. How do you display address in HTML?
- `address` (non-void and semantic) element
  - `br` (void) to break addresses into several different lines
  - anchor link with `tel:+` attribute for phone number
  - anchor link with `mailto:` for email address
Example
```
 <address>
  <h2>Company Name</h2>
  <p>
    1234 Elm Street<br />
    Springfield, IL 62701<br />
    United States
  </p>
  <p>Phone: <a href="tel:+15555555555">+1 (555) 555-5555</a></p>
  <p>Email: <a href="mailto:contact@company.com">contact@company.com</a></p>
 </address>
```
## 4. How do you display times and dates in HTML?
- `time` (non-void and semantic) element
  - `datetime` attribute: machin-readable format
    - in the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format
    - must be either a valid year, valid month, valid time, local date, global date, or valid duration string
    - full time format is YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM
      > - first part of that value is the year, month and day\
      > - capital T in the value is a separator between the date and time.
Example
```
<p>
  The graduation will be on <time datetime="2024-06-15T15:00">June 15</time>
</p>

\\OR\\

<p>The reservations are for <time datetime="20:00">20:00 </time></p>
```

## Suggestions for this lecture
1. Could do with more examples e.g., with the mentioned `datetime` options
2. again not much hands on exercise
