# Day 60: 

## Key topics covered (continued from Day 56)
- [x] Common File Types You Will Work With in Web Applications?

## 4. The main file types that you will find in web applications 
### 4.1 Three main ones:
- HTML: .html
- CSS: .css
- JavaScript: .js

### 4.2 Images
- JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group):
  - known for effecient compression
  - good for photographs and images
  - compresson is lossy
- PNG (Portable Network Graphics):
  - larger files that preserves imag quality even after compression
  - supports transparency and it's great for images with sharp edges, like logos and icons.
- GIF (Graphics Interchange Format): supports both animation and transparency but has a limited color palette
- SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics): vector image format that can be scaled as much as needed without losing quality.

### 4.3 Audio/Video
- MP3: one of the most common audio format, good compression and supports multiple audio and video codecs, subtitles, and metadata.
- MP4: one of the most common video format, good compression and supports multiple audio and video codecs, subtitles, and metadata.
- MOV: QuickTime multimedia file format developed by Apple
- WAV: a lossless audio format that keeps the original quality of the audio
- WebM: a high-quality open-source video format.

### 4.4 Fonts
- TTF (Tru Type Fonts): a font format compatible with different operating systems.
- WOFF (Web Open Font Format): a modern font format, specifically designed for web development purposes
  - smaller sizes and better compression
  - can also store metadata, including licensing information.
  > WOFF2 - the successor of WOFF with even more efficient compression and performance.

### 4.5 Archive
- ZIP: most commonly used archive format that
  - offers lossless compression
  - widely supported across operating systems and software applications

### 4.6 Documentation
In web applications, you will usually find a file called README that contains information about the application, like how to use it, how to install it, its license, and how to contribute.

They are usually written in a file format called Markdown (extension `.md` or `markdown`).

With Markdown, you can create structured documents with headings, subheadings, links, images, lists, and more.
