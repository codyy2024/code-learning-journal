Decided to have one day off a week for studying.

My wife has been saying "I feel I don't know you" as I've been in the loop of waking > preparing baby for and dropping her off at nursery > work > eat > preparing baby for dinner and/or sleeping > study > sleep...

Just one day to not study and enjoy being with each other.

That's it.
