# Workshop: Build a Cat Photo App - Part 1 (up to Step 17)
## **My** key enhanced takeways on boilerplate:
- `main` element (nesting `h` and `p` elements in it) should only appear once and not repeated
- nesting and 2-space indentation as best practice to make HTML code easier to read
- The typical content perceived by a coding newbie like me, is a string of text or numbers. But image is also a piece of content - it's just for the image to be able to render in HTML, you can't just drag and drop or upload an image. Rather, you need to use the `img` element to retrieve it as a readable "content" for HTML, then this image content is nested in the anchor `a` element like the typically perceived content
- Break down into steps when nesting; otherwise you may be finding yourself like flies bumping into lights headlessly. Take applying a link to an image for example,
  - firstly you have the anchor tags `<a></a>`
  - then you have the `href` added in `<a href="example.com"></a>` which specifies the URL of the anchored link
  - now, as you **must** have link text for anchor link element - in this case the link *text* is the image - you have the `img` element nested inside `a` element `<a href="example.com"><img></a>`
  - as the penultimate step, you need to specify where to retrieve the image i.e. the `src` (source URL) of the image `<a href="example.com"><img src="example.com/abcd123.jpg></a>`
  - as the final step, add the `target` attribute of the opening `a` tag, and the `alt` attribute of the `img` tag
```<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta .../>
    <title>...</title>
    <link.../>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
      <h1>...<h1>
      <h2>...</h2>
      ...
      <p>...<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">..<img src="https://example.com/abcd123.jpg" alt="accessibility-friendly alt title">..</a>...</p>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>```
