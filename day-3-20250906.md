# Workshop: Build a Cat Photo App - Part 1 (up to Step 17)
## **My** key enhanced takeways on boilerplate:
- `main` element (nesting `h` and `p` elements in it) should only appear once and not repeated
- nesting and 2-space indentation as best practice to make HTML code easier to read
- The typical content perceived by a coding newbie like me, is a string of text or numbers. But image is also a piece of content - it's just for the image to be able to render in HTML, you can't just drag and drop or upload an image. Rather, you need to use the `img` element to retrieve it as a readable "content" for HTML, then this image content is nested in the anchor `a` element like the typically perceived content
```<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta .../>
    <title>...</title>
    <link.../>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
      <h1>...<h1>
      <h2>...</h2>
      ...
      <p>...<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">..<img src="https://example.com/abcd123.jpg alt="accessibility-friendly alt title>..</a>...</p>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>```
