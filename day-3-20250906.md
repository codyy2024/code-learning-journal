# Workshop: Build a Cat Photo App - Part 1 (up to Step 6)
## Boilerplate enhancement:
- `main` should only appear once and not repeated
- nesting and 2-space indentation as best practice to make HTML code easier to read
- 
```<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta .../>
    <title>...</title>
    <link.../>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
      <h1>...<h1>
      <h2>...</h2>
      ...
      <p>...</p>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>```
