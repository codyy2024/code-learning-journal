# Day 19: Basic HTML Quiz

Today is yet again another tiring day.

Baby woke up/cried multiple times again during the night, and a cousin of ours is having a Full Moon Celebration of their baby daughter so we went down to central London - that is, went out at 10am and didn't get back until 5pm (and ofc we didn't get the chance to take a nap).

I yet still want to stick to my "study everyday no matter what, even if it's juts 15 mins". My wife has been saying "don't burn out yourself" etc. over the last couple of days, and said something in Cantonese that can be translated into something like "Even you are going to be hung, you still need to take a break/breath" ðŸ˜†

So here I am, not taking a breath. It is the quiz for basic HTML knowledge so hopefully a 15-min thing.

Things still feel a bit foreign to me somehow:
- script (Q6)
- iframe (Q18)

But clear enough I got a 100% pass.

DONE - ready for the next chapter **Semantic HTML** from tomorrow.
