# Day 12: Lecture - Working with the `iframe` Element
Learn how to work with the `iframe` element which is used to embed an external site on your web page.

Key learning points covered:   
- [x] Replaced element   
- [x] Embed videos onto your page using the `iframe` element
- [x] Embed other elements (map, another HTML element, or web page) onto you page using the `iframe` element

## Replaced element   
An element whose content is determined by an external resource rather than by CSS itself. Three common examples below.
- `img`
  > The element itself is replaced with the external object: the image.  
    > > Your CSS can control things like the positioning of the image, or apply a filter to it, but you cannot actually modify the image itself.
- `iframe`
  > The element itself is replaced with the external object: the site.  
  > > Examples: embed maps or YouTube videos
- `video`
- `embed`
- `input` - but only under specific circumstances
  > Example:  
  > - `<input type="image" alt="Descriptive text goes here" src="example-img-url">` - this type of `input` is considered to be a replaced element;  
  > - if the type is `text` then this `input` is not a replaced element. 
  
## Embed videos onto your page using the `iframe` element   
`iframe` stands for inline frame (not void). **Q**: what does frame even mean?   
Syntax:
```
      <iframe
        src="video-url"
        width="width-value"
        height="height-value"
        allowfullscreen
        title="your-title"
      ></iframe>
  ```    
- An inline element to embed other HTML content directly with your HTML page. These HTML content can be
  - Video
    ```
    <iframe
            src="https://youtube.com/embed/gp5H0Vw39yw?si=Rb_2nDK6abv1iIAM"
            title="freeCodeCamp Typescript Course"
            width="500"
            height="285"
            allowfullscreen
    ></iframe> 
    ```
    > - YouTube: you either click Share > choose embed and copying the embed code YouTube provides, or Share > copying the "...youtu.be..." link > change it to "...youtube.com/embed..."
      ```
        <iframe
          width="560"
          height="315"
          src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PkZNo7MFNFg?si=-UBVIUNM3csdeiWF"
          title="YouTube video player"
          allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
          referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
          allowfullscreen
        ></iframe>
      ```
    > - But it doesn't have to be YouTube or Vimeo, can be other source for example Pixabay:
      ```
        <iframe
          src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/video/2022/07/24/125310-733046613_large.mp4"
          width="500"
          height="285"
        ></iframe>
      ```
  - Map
    ```
      <h1>A Map from Openstreetmap.org Embedded with the iframe Element</h1>
  
      <iframe
        width="425"
        height="350"
        src="https://www.openstreetmap.org/export/embed.html?bbox=3.006134033203125%2C6.150112578753815%2C3.6357879638671875%2C6.749850810550778&amp;layer=mapnik"
        style="border: 1px solid black"
      >
      </iframe>
      <br />
      <small>
        <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=11/6.4501/3.3210">
          View Larger Map
        </a>
      </small>
    ```
  - Another HTML element
    > have to use `srcdoc` element instead of `src`
  - Other web pages

## What didn't go well
1. The conception of "frame" is not clear to me in the first place before diving into "iframe"
2. Didn't find the "...youtu.be..." as mentioned in the course. Was copying and pasting the link from the browser URL bar which has the URL in the form of "...youtube.com...watch...", and nowhere to find either "...youtu.be..." or "youtube.com.../embed..."

      > > 2nd level notes go here
      > > > 3rd level notes go here
## What went well
N/A

## <ins>Suggestions for this episode</ins>
1. Explain the conception of "frame" first
2. If the main focus was (as per the title of the second part) is "video", then perhaps worth giving more explicit instructions of e.g., the YouTube URL topic in the [What didn't go well](#what-didnt-go-well) section
