## 1. WAI-ARIA overview
### 1.1 What is 
Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications, a sematic-friendly specification that enhances accessibility for dynamic/interactive content and UI (User Interface) components that do not have native HTML equivalents.
### 1.2 How it's used
WAI-ARIA works by introducing a set of attributes you can add to HTML elements to provide additional semantic information. These attributes are categorized into 
- Roles: defines the purpose of an element within a website or web app. Roles **do not** provide any functionality however.
  
  > Example: indicates to assistive technology that the element is a button. 
    > ```
    >  <div role="button">Click Me</div>
    > ```
- states   
  ?
- properties: provide additional details about elements.
  
  > Example: `aria-labelledby` property lets you connect an element to a specific label, and make the elements understandable and navigable for users of assistive technologies.
  > ```
  > <h2 id="header-id">About freeCodeCamp</h2>
  > <button id="button-id" aria-labelledby="header-id button-id">Learn More</button>
  > ```

*Avoid overusing ARIA as it can be confusing many times - use WAI-ARIA only when HTML falls shory.*

## 2. What Are ARIA Roles?
ARIA roles specify the semantic meaning of HTML elements - `role="ARIA role"`.

Six main categories of ARIA roles:

### 2.1 Document structure roles
Define the overall structure of the web page.

However, modern browsers already support equivalent semantic HTML elements, which should be prioritized whenever possible. Most common non-HTML-equivalent roles: `toolbar`, `tooltip`, `feed`, `math`, `presentation`, `none`, and `note`.
  
### 2.2 Widget roles
Define the purpose and functionality of interactive elements.

Examples: `scrollbar`, `searchbox`, `separator` (when focusable), `slider`, `spinbutton`, `switch`, `tab`, `tabpanel`, and `treeitem`.

### 2.3 Landmark roles
Classify and label the primary sections of a web page.

If you use the proper HTML elements to define the sections of your page then it is not necessary to explicitly add the role attribute to these elements.</br>
- Example of Land mark roles: banner, complementary, contentinfo, form, main, navigation, region, and search
- The HTML elements equivalent of these: `header`, `footer`, `aside`, `form`, `main`, `nav`, `section`, and `search`

### 2.4 Live region roles
Define elements with content that will change dynamically. 

Allo assistive technologies announce changes to users with visual disabilities. These roles include: `alert`, `log`, `marquee`, `status`, and `timer`.


### 2.5 Window roles
Define sub-windows, like pop up modal dialogues. These roles include `alertdialog` and `dialog`.

It is now considered a best practice to use the HTML `dialog` element and its associated JavaScript methods instead of manually creating a dialog.

### 2.6 Abstract roles
Help organize the document.

Only meant to be used internally by the browser, not by developers, so you should know that they exist but you shouldn't use them on your websites or web applications.
