## 1. WAI-ARIA overview
### 1.1 What is 
Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications, a sematic-friendly specification that enhances accessibility for dynamic/interactive content and UI (User Interface) components that do not have native HTML equivalents.
### 1.2 How it's used
WAI-ARIA works by introducing a set of attributes you can add to HTML elements to provide additional semantic information. These attributes are categorized into 
- Roles: defines the purpose of an element within a website or web app. Roles **do not** provide any functionality however.
  
  > Example: indicates to assistive technology that the element is a button. 
    > ```
    >  <div role="button">Click Me</div>
    > ```
- states   
  ?
- properties: provide additional details about elements.
  
  > Example: `aria-labelledby` property lets you connect an element to a specific label, and make the elements understandable and navigable for users of assistive technologies.
  > ```
  > <h2 id="header-id">About freeCodeCamp</h2>
  > <button id="button-id" aria-labelledby="header-id button-id">Learn More</button>
  > ```

*Avoid overusing ARIA as it can be confusing many times - use WAI-ARIA only when HTML falls shory.*

## 2. What Are ARIA Roles?
ARIA roles specify the semantic meaning of HTML elements - `role="ARIA role"`.

Six main categories of ARIA roles:

### 2.1 Document structure roles
Define the overall structure of the web page.

However, modern browsers already support equivalent semantic HTML elements, which should be prioritized whenever possible. Most common non-HTML-equivalent roles: `toolbar`, `tooltip`, `feed`, `math`, `presentation`, `none`, and `note`.
  
### 2.2 Widget roles
Define the purpose and functionality of interactive elements.

Examples: `scrollbar`, `searchbox`, `separator` (when focusable), `slider`, `spinbutton`, `switch`, `tab`, `tabpanel`, and `treeitem`.

### 2.3 Landmark roles
Classify and label the primary sections of a web page.

If you use the proper HTML elements to define the sections of your page then it is not necessary to explicitly add the role attribute to these elements.</br>
- Example of Land mark roles: banner, complementary, contentinfo, form, main, navigation, region, and search
- The HTML elements equivalent of these: `header`, `footer`, `aside`, `form`, `main`, `nav`, `section`, and `search`

### 2.4 Live region roles
Define elements with content that will change dynamically. 

Allo assistive technologies announce changes to users with visual disabilities. These roles include: `alert`, `log`, `marquee`, `status`, and `timer`.


### 2.5 Window roles
Define sub-windows, like pop up modal dialogues. These roles include `alertdialog` and `dialog`.

It is now considered a best practice to use the HTML `dialog` element and its associated JavaScript methods instead of manually creating a dialog.

### 2.6 Abstract roles
Help organize the document.

Only meant to be used internally by the browser, not by developers, so you should know that they exist but you shouldn't use them on your websites or web applications.

## 3. What Are the Roles of the aria-label and aria-labelledby Attributes?

They both do the same thing - provide labels for elements to enhance accessibility for screen readers.

But they are different as well:
- `aria-label` value is the text that the screenreader will announce to its users. Especially useful for elements that do not have visible text but still need to be described by screen readers. For example
  ```
  <button aria-label="Search">
  <i class="fas fa-search"></i>
  </button>
  ```
  For this one above, screenreader may announce "Search, button" ("Search" as in the `aria-lanbel` value in the double quotes)
- `aria-labelledby` value is the reference of the text that the screenreader will use to refer to to announce to its users. For example
  ```
  <input type="text" aria-labelledby="search-btn">
  <button type="button" id="search-btn">Search</button>
  ```
 It doesn't matter if later the button text "Search" in `...>Search</button>` is changed or not, as `aria-labelledby` will always refer to the id `search-btn` and announce whatever value it is for this id.

Note:
- either `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` can be used but **do not** use them on an element at the same time.
- `aria-labelledby` should be used over `aria-label` esp. when there is existing visible text on the page that can be used as a label. Because
  - If someone is using a translation service to translate the content on your page, the text in an `aria-label` attribute may not always be translated.
  - Using `aria-labelledby` can also help prevent a mismatch between the visible label text and the invisible label for screen reader users since updating the visible text will automatically update the invisible label.
  - `aria-labelledby` can make it much easier to programmatically create complex invisible labels consisting of multiple sources of text.
    ```
    <div>
    <span id="volume-label">Volume</span>
    <span id="volume-details">Adjust the volume level</span>
    <input
      type="range"
      min="0"
      max="100"
      value="30"
      aria-labelledby="volume-label volume-details">
    </div>
    ```
    The screen reader will look out for the content of the volume-label and volume-details elements and announce Volume Adjust the volume level.

## 4. What Is the aria-hidden Attribute, and How Does It Work?
This attribute hides the element and all of its children from the accessibility tree, while keeping them visible on the page.

The use case for  `aria-hidden` is very narrow and should be limited primarily to making the experience cleaner for screen reader users by removing purely decorative or duplicate information. 

> Note:
> The aria-hidden attribute only removes the element from the accessibility tree. It does not remove it from the DOM.\
> --- ---  
> What's DOM - DOM stands for Document Object Model. It’s a programming interface that represents an HTML (or XML) document as a tree of objects that can be accessed and manipulated by code — usually JavaScript.   
>Example HTML:
> ```
><html>
>  <body>
>    <h1>Hello</h1>
>    <p>Welcome to HTML learning!</p>
>   </body>
></html>
> ```
> What DOM ree looks like:
> ```
> Document
> └── html
>      └── body
>           ├── h1 → "Hello"
>           └── p  → "Welcome to HTML learning!"
> ```

You do not need to use aria-hidden when:
- The HTML element already has a hidden attribute.
- The element or the element's ancestor is already hidden with display: none.
- The element or the element's ancestor is already hidden with visibility: hidden.

The setting `aria-hidden` to `false` will not work if any of its parents has this attribute set to true.

## 5. What Is the aria-describedby Attribute, and How Does It Work?
