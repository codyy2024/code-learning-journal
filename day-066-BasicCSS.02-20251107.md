## 1. What Is the Meta Viewport Element Used For?
`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`
- what is `viewport`: a special HTML meta element that gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling on different devices, particularly on mobile phones and tablets.
- `width=device-width`: tells the browser to set the width of the page to match the screen width of the device.
- `initial-scale=1.0`: set the initial zoom to 100%
- DO NOT SUGGEST using `user-scalable=no` attribute to disable zooming, ensuring that all users can comfortably access your content at different zoom levels.
