# Day 10: Lecture - Working with Images and SVGs
(Wait is SVG not a type of image format??)

A bit tired and sleepy from a late till 11pm learning yesterday, and a 6.45am to 9am driving lesson then working day today. But will continue without breaking one day even if it's less time than I would've hoped.

First things first I stumbled upon 1) the Github Markdown syntax documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) and 2) the [Discussion](https://github.com/codyy2024/code-learning-journal/discussions) function and the [Github pages](https://github.com/codyy2024/code-learning-journal/settings/pages) (excited about this one - more for later!)

Key learning points covered:   
- [x] Optimize media assets - size, format and compression
- [x] Media/Image license/copyright
- [x] SVGs

## Optimise media assets  
[intro paragraph goes here]
- Size
  - don't want your users to download unncessary data (larger size)
- Format
  - PNG and JPG are two most common ones but not ideal for serving images
  - should use optimised format WEBP or AVIF
- Compression algorithm
  - consider loseless format or not (e.g., JPG is not)
    > Loseless: the original data can be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data withoud degrade on quality
## Media/Image license/copyright   
Default license for images: all rights reserved.
- Pay
  - Obtain written permision
  - Purchase a license
  - incorporate that falls under "fair use" (tricky!)
- Premissive license
  - Creative Commons
  - BSD License (freeCodeCamp uses)
  <ins>NEED TO UNDERSTAND RULES</ins>, for example, you have to make your website open source.
- Public domain
  > An image under the public domain has no copyright attached to it and is free to be used without any restrictions.
  - Creative Commons 0 license
## SVGs   
An image which stores paths, lines, points, and curves.

How images work: understand images from the root
- PNG/JPG: raster formats\
  - Pixel-based, with the data tracking the colour value in each pixel\  
  - Downside: do not upscale well e.g., becomes blurry if make a PNG larger
- SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic)
  - Can be scaled to any size without impacting the quality
  - Added benefit of storing data in XML (what does this even mean?)
    > you can use them directly in your code as raw HTML with the `svg` element  
    > you can programmatically change the color of the image
- When to use SVG
  - Icons
    > icon library, Font Awesome, uses SVG images for their icons
  - Custom bullet points
  - webpage logos

End result
```
<svg width="100" height="100" viewBox="0 0 100 100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="45" stroke="black" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow" />
  <circle cx="35" cy="40" r="5" fill="black" />
  <circle cx="65" cy="40" r="5" fill="black" />
  <path d="M35 65 Q50 80 65 65" stroke="black" stroke-width="4" fill="transparent" />
</svg>
```
Each SVG element has attributes that control its appearance and position within the drawing area.
- `svg`: the container for the whole drawing
- `circle`: make the face and the eyes
- `path`: draw smile

Renders this:\
<img width="109" height="110" alt="smiley face" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ff149db-56dd-493d-ba49-355d68ebcbee" />

## <ins>Suggestions for this episode</ins>
More code examples? But maybe this will be covered later down the line (in Workshop or Lab)
