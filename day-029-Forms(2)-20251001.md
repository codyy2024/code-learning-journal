# Day 29: 

[Continued from Day 28]

## 3. How to use client-side form validation?
Validation ensures that the user fixes those formating mistakes (i.e. invalid data) before the information is submitted and processed by the server.
### 3.1 "Client-side" - what we'll focus in this module
Refers to everything that happens on the user's computer or device
- `required` attribute (boolean)
- `minlength` and `maxlength` attributes (non-boolean)

> Each browser will have its own set of styles for showing the alert message if users try to submit without filling the required fields.\

**Q: What will the alert message content be?**
A: Gave it a go using the example
```
<form action="">
  <label for="email">Email Address (Required field):</label>
  <input
    required
    type="email"
    name="email"
    id="email"
    minlength="4"
    maxlength="64"
  />
  <button type="submit">Submit Form</button>
</form>
```
Result:
1. If I leave it empty and submit: \
   <img width="404" height="72" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49c499cc-d026-48cd-bdc9-ae34f3c52e7f" />
2. If I type in one character without an @ sign:\
   <img width="427" height="78" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c7683f9-25f3-4dc4-ab65-308c6ceda808" />
3. If I type in one character plus an @ sign:\
   <img width="401" height="79" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f65dc982-8548-4eda-a930-7c6b194c21c6" />
4. If I type in one character each before and after the @ sign (making it 3 characters):\
   <img width="482" height="71" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c688e3f0-0490-4f36-b344-ffedd72d3a09" />
6. If I type in one character before and two characters after the @ sign (making it 4 characters):\
   No alert message!



### 3.2 "Server-side" - covers in a later module
Refers to everything that happens on the server, the computer, or system, that hosts the website or app.

## 4. How to use Form states
Different form states is important because they ensure a smooth user experience by providing clear feedback and guidance while handling errors.
- `default`: a blank input when the user arrived at the page first time AND has not input any information.
- `focused`: when the user clicks on a form control or selects it with the keyboard's tab key
  > Most browsers will show a blue highlighted border around the input. But you can choose to add additional styles in CSS.
- `disabled`: shows users that an input cannot be focused or activated
- `readonly` & `value` alongside it: when a form control, like an input, is not editable by the user
  > Can show `focused` state

What it looks like (`readonly` in `focused` state):\
<img width="517" height="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/450ec04d-c0f9-461e-932b-a341f6883f21" />

## What did't go well
Again it would be helpful to have a render-as-you-code view/function inside this course.

## What did go well
Seems to easy to understand - with the testing with visuals from my side

## Suggestions
To have a render-as-you-code view/function inside this course.
