## 1. Understanding computer, internet and tooling basics

### 1.1 As devs it's important to understand the inner working of a computer.
- motherboard
- CPU
- PSU (power supply unit)
- short term memory (RAM - Randome Access Memory: decides the performance of the computer
  > volatile memory: lost when computer is turned off
- hard disk drive (HDD) or Static State Drive (SSD): store files
  > non-volatile
- expansion cards
  - video card (GPU)
  - sound card
  - network card

### 1.2 Healthy tips using computers
1. mouse grip - relaxed, gentle grip
2. ergonomic keyboards and mouse
3. keep mouse the same height of the keyboard
4. overall posture
5. keyboard shortbuts when possible to avoid typing

### 1.3 ISPs (Internet Service Providers)
- Three tiers
   1. giant conglomerate companies, which have the infrastructure to handle most (if not all) of their network traffic independently.
   2. country-wide providers, which sometimes rent access to tier 1 networks but can stand fairly well on their own.
   3. small companies that primarily focus on providing internet to local markets, and rely on larger ISPs to provide their infrastructure.
- Different types
  1. Fibre optic connection
  2. Cable connections
  3. DSL connections (Digital Subscriber Line)
     - Dial-up also an option
  5. Satellite connections
  6. 5G home internet provider

 ### 1.4 Safe Ways to Sign Into Your Computer

 ### 1.5 What Are the Different Types of Tools Professional Developers Use?
1. computer
2. program for writing and editing code: code editor or integrated development environmrent (IDE)
  - IDEs: like Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, JetBrains, and PyCharm provide powerful features like code completion, debugging, and integrated terminal support.
  - Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is essentially a code editor, but it also provides these functionalities with its rich extension library.
  - Other code editors are Sublime Text, Atom, Notepad++, and Brackets.
3. version control system to track the changes you make to code you write in code editors and IDEs
  - **Git** is the most widely used version control system in the development community.
  - Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket provide cloud-based hosting services for your Git repositories. These platforms enable collaboration with other developers, allow you to work on multiple branches, and facilitate the merging of code changes.
4. Package managers
   - NPM, Yarn, and PNPM for JavaScript
   - PIP for Python
   - Composer for PHP
   - Maven for Java
5. testing
   5.1 General testing frameworks     
   - NPM, Yarn, and PNPM for JavaScript
   - PIP for Python
   - Composer for PHP
   - Maven for Java
   5.2 Language-specific testing frameworks
   - Jest for JavaScript
   - pytest for Python
   - JUnit for Java
   - PHPUnit for PHP
