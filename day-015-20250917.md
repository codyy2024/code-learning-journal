# Day 15: Lecture - Working with Links

Chitchat: I am very tired today after being woken up by my little angel at ðŸ•  05:10, then working non-stop except lunch time till 18:40 ðŸ˜ª. But I promised myself to self-descipline this time, and also realised after the [mini-break]() that even one day of break can make what you've learnt so far seem foreign again.

So let's keep it going! ðŸ¦¾

## Key learning points covered:   
- [x] `target` attribute and its 4 important types  
- [x] path: absolute and relative
- [x] path: difference between slashes, single dot and double dot

---

## `target`
Important attribute that tells the browser where to open the URL for the `a` element;  
Comes preceded with an underscore;   
Four important ones:
- `_self` (default) opens in the current tab or window
- `_blank` opens the link in a new tab/window
- `_parent` opens in parent tab/window
  > e.g. `iframe` on a web page that has `_parent`, the link will be opened as a new website tab/window, not within the embedded `iframe`
    >> **Q**: This means that the `iframe` has anchor link, but the previous `iframe` lessons are all about using it to put video/audio in it.
- `_top` is essentially `_parent`'s `_parent` - link will always open in the full browser tab/window, even for nested embedded frames
- `_unfencedTop`: used for experimental FencedFrame API (not covered in this lecture)
  
## path   
A path is a string that specifies the location of a file or directory in a file system.
### Absolute: a complete link to a resource that starts with a slash (`/` or `\`)

Formula: root directory + every other directory + the filename and extension.
- Resource on the web

  Formula: protocol + domain name + filename & extension
  ```
  <a href="https://design-style-guide.freecodecamp.org/img/fcc_secondary_small.svg">
  View fCC Logo
  </a>
  ```
  Where `https` is the protocol.
  
- Resource on your local machine
  Formula: folder hierarchy + filename & extension
  ```
  <p>
  Read more on the
  <a
    href="/Users/user/Desktop/fCC/script-code/absolute-vs-relative-paths/pages/about.html"
    >About Page</a
    >
  </p>
  ```
  What it looks like in browser: `file:///Users/user/Desktop/fCC/script-code/absolute-vs-relative-paths/pages/about.html`, where `file://` is the protocol.
### Relative: specifies the location of a file relative to the directory of the current file
Example of linking to the about.html page from the contact.html page, both of which are in the same folder:
```
<p>
  Read more on the
  <a href="about.html">About Page</a>
</p>
```

## path: difference between slashes, single dot and double dot   
### slash `/` or `\` depending on OS: *"Path separator" - used to indicate a break in the text between folder or file names*
Example: `naomis-files/` points to a directory of that same name; whereas `naomis/files/` points to a `files` directory in the `naomis` directory.
### single dot `.`: *points to the current directory (typically relative)*
### double dot `..`: *point to the parent directory - commonly used to access files outside of the current working directory*
> Example:
```
my-app/
â”œâ”€ public/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ favicon.ico
â”‚  â”œâ”€ index.html
â”œâ”€ src/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ index.css
â”‚  â”œâ”€ index.js
```
Imagine you are on `index.html`
- if you need to load the `favicon.ico` file: `./favicon.ico` (use a relative path with a single dot to access the current directory)
- if you need to load the `index.css` file: `../src/index.css` (use a relative path with double dots to navigate to the parent my-app directory first, then to the src directory, and finally to your file)

## What didn't go well
1. path & link
COnfused me quite abit there: in the [second lesson](#path) it kind of says the absolute path for web content is "https://....", where the `https' is the protocol. So I chose that as the answer to one of the questions in the end of the 3rd lesson, only to be told that the abolute path starts with a slash, which besically means

4. li3
      > 1st level notes go here
      > > 2nd level notes go here

## What went well

3. li3
      > 1st level notes go here
      > > 2nd level notes go here
