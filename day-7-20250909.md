# Day 7: Lecture - HTML Fundamentals
## What are they different from the HTML basics we've learnt up to *Day 6: Build a Recipe Page*?
- Up to Day 6: understand what HTML is and what it consists of
- From Day 7: the fun stuff!
### The `div` element
The Content Division Element - a beautiful being that can be anything you want it to be.
- `height`, `width`, CSS etc.
- hold/group elements together (compare with semantic elements like `section`)
  > Semantics are the meaning of words or phrases in a language (HTML - Hypertext Markup Language). For a section element, the browser will pick up its semantic meaning and understand to treat this as a section (on desktops, mobiles etc.)
### The `id` and `class` attributes
| Elements | Notes | When to use |
| ------ | ----- | ----- |
| `id` | See h3 below | Target specific elements (that sits in the element the `id` lives) | 
| `class` | See h3 below | Apply a set of styles to many elements (that sits in the main/parent element the `class` lives)| 
##### `id` 
- adds a unique identifier/name (value of the attribute `id`) to an HTML element, e.g., `<h1 id="title">Movie Review Page</h1>`  
  - unique: same `id` name should **not** be used more than once
  - **no** space in `id` names: should only contain letters, digits, underscores, and dashes.
- the `id` name can then be referenced in JavaScript or CSS, e.g., `#title {color: red;}`
  - the hashtag `#` tells the computer to target an `id` with the value after it
#### `class`
- attribute value does not need to be unique and can contain spaces e.g., `<div class="box red-box"></div>`     
- the `class` name can then be referenced in JavaScript or CSS, e.g.,
  ```
    .box {
      width: 200px;
      height: 200px;
      border: 2px solid black;
    }   
  ```
  - the dot `.` symbol tells the computer to target a class with the value(s) after it
### HTML entities
Aka character reference - is a set of characters used to represent a reserved character in HTML. So computer reads it as content (that's showing to users) rather than an HTML element (not showing to end users)
| Entities | Format | Example (for the less than `<` symbol |
| --- | --- | ---- |
| Named character reference | start with an ampersand sign (&) and end with a semicolon (;) | `&gt;` |
| Decimal numeric reference | starts with an ampersand sign and hash symbol (#), followed by one or more decimal digits, followed by a semicolon. | `&#60;` |
| Hexadecimal numeric reference | starts with an ampersand sign, hash symbol, and the letter x. Then it is followed by one or more ASCII hex digits and ends with a semicolon | `&#x3C;` |
- Some other examples of HTML entities: ©, ", trademark symbol ™
### The Script element
- Used to embed executable code
  - Mainly JavaScript, to add interacitvity, e.g., interactive games, image sliders, and dynamic forms that validate user input in real-time.
- Separation of concerns - a design principle where you separate your programs into distinct sections and have each section address a separate concern. In this case, we want to separate our JavaScript code from our HTML code.
  > Example: `<script src="path-to-javascript-file.js"></script>`
### The Meta description
Set a description of a web page to help with SEO   
```
<meta
name="description"
content="Discover expert tips and techniques for gardening in small spaces, choosing the right plants, and maintaining a thriving garden."
/>
```

### Open Graph Tags
- Controls how your website's content appears across various social media platforms, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and many more.
  - When your content is shared on social media, well-crafted OG properties can enhance the appearance for your content in users' feeds. This can lead to higher click-through rates which could signal to search engines that your content is relevant and engaging.
- The open graph `url`, `image`, `type`, and `title` are the most important ones to include.
  > Examples
  > - `<meta content="freeCodeCamp.org" property="og:title" />`
  > - `<meta property="og:type" content="website" />`
  > - `<meta content="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_meta_1920X1080-indigo.png" property="og:image" />`
  > - `<meta property="og:url" content="https://www.freecodecamp.org" />`
