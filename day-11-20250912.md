# Day 11: Workshop - Build a Heart IconUsing SVG
Built it following the instructions (copying & pasting really) but don't really understand what I was doing and how it worked.

All I rememebr is the below:
- `width` and `height` for icons need to be set small
- `viewbox` first two numbers set the centre; the follwoing two width and height (Q: why repeat as we've already set these?)
- `d` refers to draw, letters represent commands like move to, draw line, and close, while the numbers represent coordinates.

## What didn't go well
1. Literally just coped ans paste - didn't really learn and understand how it workss

End result

```
<svg width="24", height="24" viewbox="0 0 24 24" fill="red" >

Unless there are more deeper content later, maybe explain a bit more since you're saying you're trying to explain (but didn't quite really)
