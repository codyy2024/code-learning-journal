# Boilerplate & its core componments
Figured out how to use Github to keep coding learning journals
## What is boilerplate?  
- A ready-made template for your webpages
## Why use boilerplate?
- Foundation structure and contains **all** key HTML elements, so you know your web pages are set to work from the beginning
- Saves time and can customise when you gain experience and confidence
## What consists of a boilerplate?
1. On the very first level/To start with:  `DOCTYPE` declaration element
     > `<!DOCTYPE html>`: tells browsers which version of HTML you're using
2. Next comes the `html` element:
     > `<html lang="en"><!--All other elements go inside here--></html>`: wraps around all your content & specify the language of your page 
4. Inside the `html` element comes the two main elements `head` and `body`
     - `<head><!--Important metadata goes here--></head>`: all the details of your web pages' metadata wrapped around `meta`, `title`, `link` etc. elements   

       ---
       > `meta`: information about a webpage that browsers, search engines, and social networks use it to understand your pages
       >> `<meta charset="UTF-8" />` - for each new project you create, you should include this `meta` element with the `charset` attribute set to `UTF-8`.
       >  - Void/self-closing tag
       > - UTF-8 supports every character in the Unicode character set - and this includes characters and symbols from all writing systems, languages, and technical symbols.  
       >   > Example: UTF-8 ensures that `Café` is displayed correctly with the accented `"e"` character `é`  
       ---
       > `link`
          > - Void/self-closing tag
          > - Formula: `<link rel="extrenal resource name" href="./external-resource-url" />`  
          >   >Typical external source: stylesheet, font, favicon
     - `<body><!--Headings, paragraphs, images, etc. go inside here--></body>`: all content goes in `body` element
