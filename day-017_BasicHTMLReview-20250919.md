# Day 19: Basic HTML Review - Part 2

I have to admit - yesterday to today has been quite a day: woken up by my little one several times (she's got a cold and runny/stuffy nose), a driving lesson as usual from 7am to 9am, then work pretty non stop till 5pm.

I will stick my self-descipline, but maybe reduce the time. So there will be at least Part 3, maybe more. Let's see.
