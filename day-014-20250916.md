Key learning points covered:   
- [x] `section`   
- [x] `iframe`
- [x] Re-emphasize of
  - `main`
    - `h1` under it should only appear once
    - `section` under it
      - `iframe`
        - the attributes within `iframe` **opening tag**
          - `src`: how to pull the src url of a YouTube video
          - `title`
          - `height` (YouTube sets to 315)
          - `width` (YouTube sets to 560)
      - `h2` can apear more than once

## Revise of `section`   
What is section - I honestly __forgot__ üò¢. And that's okay - let's revise from [Day 005](https://github.com/codyy2024/code-learning-journal/blob/main/day-005-20250907.md)
### `iframe` under `section` as a child element   
#### `iframe` attributes
- `src`
- `title`
- `width`
- `height`

## What didn't go well
1. Forgot about `section` completely
2. Forgot about `iframe` pretty much
3. Even when I followed the hints, first time I did it, I included the attributes between the right angle bracket of the opening tag and the left angle bracket of the closing tag
   ```
   <iframe>
     src=""
     title=""
     width=""
     height=""
   </iframe>
   ```
   and then it errored with all of my three `iframe`

   Then realised, like all the usual attributes before I learnt `iframe`, they should all sit within the opening tag after the opening name.

   ```
   <iframe
     src=""
     title=""
     width=""
     height=""
   ></iframe>
   ```

## What went well
1. I remembered how to pull the src embed code in a YouTube video (share > Embed)
2. Remembered `h1` only apears once
3. Noticed that when I looked at the example project, I started to think from a back end POV, i.e.
   - okay what does this consist of
   - what elements there are behind the front end "content"
   - what attributes should be used for these elements
   - any things I might be missing but can't remember?
4. My knowledge of boilerplate is still online üëç

## <ins>Suggestions for this episode</ins>
1. Could do with a recap on `iframe` and `section` somewhere in this episode
2. Could do with more deep-dive hints on the errors - but that could just be me being very fussy as I am a picky person (well, a picky eater at least üòÜ)
