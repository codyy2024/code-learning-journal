# Day 3: Mini-break
Figuring out publishing Github pages for showcasing code learning journal and CV

## Code learning journal
- Github repository: https://github.com/codyy2024/code-learning-journal/
- Publised it as https://codyy2024.github.io/code-learning-journal/, then unpublished it today, but struggle to find how to republish it with the updates made (yet still seeing the old publish is live?)

## CV
- https://github.com/codyy2024/yi-yang.cv/blob/main/README.md
