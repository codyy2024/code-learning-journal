# Day 37: Working with HTML Tools

Reminder to myself: I need to
- have dedicated session to learn how to use Github/.md syntax better/more effecetively and thoroughly (I'm only using so much of Github .md but I know there are loads more)
- have dedicated session to learn all about publishing Github pages (I've only published two tihub.io pages using the README.md file)
- have dedicated session on how to best use VS Code (as I feel like I'm only using 10% of what VS Code is capable of)
