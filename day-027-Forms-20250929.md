## 1. How do Forms, Labels and Inputs work in HTML?
Example
```
<form action="">
  <label for="email"> Email Address: </label>
  <input type="email" id="email" placeholder="Ex. example@email.com" />
</form>
```
Note: 
- the `action` attribute specifies where the form data will be sent upon submission (Q: usually a PHP server?)
- the "label for" value should be the same as the `id` value, so as to create an explicit association between the `label` and the `input` field.
- `placeholder` is optional if you want to give hints to the users about the expected input.

<br />What I wrote:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang=""en">
    <head>
        <meta charset=""UTF-8">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h3>`button` element without any attribute</h3>
        <p><button>Start Game</button></p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>`button` element with button `type` attribute</h3>
        <p>Two examples</p>
            <h4>Ex. 1</h4>
            <p><button type="button">Show Alert</button></p>
            <br />
            <h4>Ex. 2</h4>
            <p>
                <form action="">
                    <label for="email">Email address:</label>
                    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" />
                    <button type="reset">Reset form</button>
                    <button type="submit">Submit form</button>
                </form>
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <h3>`input` element with `value` specifying type</h3>
            <p><input type="button" value="Show Alert" /></p>
        <h3></h3>
        <p></p>
    </body>
</html>

## 2. How to use different types of buttons?
### 2.1 `button` element without any attribute
What it does: perform a particular action when it is activated
Example 1
```
<button>Start Game</button>
```
### 2.2 `button` element with button `type` attribute
What it does: a type attribute controls the behavior of the button when it is activated (By default, the button will not do anything when activated)
- submit a form
- show a modal
- toggle side menu open and closed
Example 2:
```
<button type="button">Show Alert</button>
```
Example 3:
```
<form action="">
  <label for="email">Email address:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" />
  <button type="reset">Reset form</button>
  <button type="submit">Submit form</button>
</form>
```
### 2.3. `input` element with `value` specifying type
Example 4:
```
<input type="button" value="Show Alert" />
```
Pros and Cons of 2.2 and 2.3
- 2.2: multiple buttons in your form could clutter up the user interface.
- 2.3: input elements are void elements, which means they cannot have child nodes, such as text, and can only have a start tag.
