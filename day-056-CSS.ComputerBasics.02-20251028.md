- [ ] how to name and organise files and folders

## 1. Overeview
### 1.1 File management application
- File Explorer in Windows
- Finder in Mac

### 1.2 Organise files
- use tags
- smart folders e.g. collections of files that are automatically organized based on criteria you set, such as file type, date, or keywords.

## 2. Best Practices for naming files and folders
Bad file name examples
- `index1234.html`
- `file-1!@.html`
- 

Good file name
- no spaces
- no special characters
- use dash to separate words
- best naming convention in that specfic programming language

Examples
- `about-us.html`
- `inde.html` - this is to represent the main page of a website. When you visit a website, the `index.html` file is the first file that is loaded.

## 3. Best Practices for File/Folder Organization in Web Applications
- README or README.md: commonly used to provide useful information about the project, such as what it does, how to use it, and any other relevant details.
- By organizing your project into assets, CSS, and HTML files, it makes it easy to find what you are looking for. This also makes it easy for other developers to contribute to your project.
