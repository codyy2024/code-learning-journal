## 1. When Is the alt Attribute Needed, and What Are Some Examples of Good Alt Text?
Alt text is used 1) in images and 2)by search engines to understand images.
## 1.1 Best practices of `alt` text for images:
+ You should try to keep alt text short but should still be detailed enough to understand the image, but not so long at the same time that it becomes confusing.
  > Example: this is too short - "A puppy", "Resort".
+ You should not try to describe every little detail. Focus on the most important aspects of the image.
+ Generally, you don't need to start with "image of" or "picture of." You can just start the description directly.
+ Also, if there's similar text around the image, you don't need to write it again.
+ It's usually recommended to end the alt text with a period for consistency.
+ If the image is a link to another page, instead of describing the image itself, the alt text should describe what will happen if users click on it.
  > Instead of
  > ```
  > <a href="about.html">
  >   <img src="arrow-right.png" alt="Right arrow." />
  > </a>
  > ```
  > It should be something like
  > ```
  > <a href="about.html">
  >   <img src="arrow-right.png" alt="Go to next page." />
  > </a>
  > ```
+ every image needs to have an alt text attribute - even if image is decorative, the `alt` attribute should be empty i.e. `alt=""`, you need to have the attribute present in your HTML code.
  - having it so it can be ignored by screen readers
  - not having it at all will result in screen readers reading the image file name
  > Example: `<img src="decorative_image.jpg" alt="" />`

## 2. Good Link Text
Descriptive links help users know where they're headed and what they'll access. 

Here are some best practices to keep in mind while writing link texts:
+ Make sure links are visually distinct by using underlining and other visual cues, so users can easily identify and navigate them.
+ Avoid generic link texts like "here", "click here", and "more-info" as they don't provide any useful information.
+ Aim for concise and descriptive link texts, ideally between 2-5 words, that convey the link's purpose.
+ Avoid jargon and abbreviations that users may not understand.
+ Focus on the destination, not the action. For example, "user behavior results", instead of "click here to read more".
+ Don’t repeat the same link text for different destinations.
+ Place links in a way that they make sense within the surrounding text. For example, "for more details, visit our events page" instead of "Click here for more".

Bad and Good examples
| Bad Example | Why bad | Good Example | Why good |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<a href="webinar-details-link">Details</a>` | doesn’t provide specific information about what the user will find if they click the link | `<a href="webinar-details-link">Get details about our upcoming webinar</a>` | reduces ambiguity by specifying that the link is related to a webinar, making it easier to decide whether they want to click on it |
| `<a href="/blog-post-link">Read more</a>` | lacks context | `<a href="/blog-post-link">Read our latest blog post on web accessibility</a>` | clearer idea of what to expect and why they might want to click the link |
| `<a href="/link-to-topic">More info</a>` | It doesn't provide specific details about the link's destination | `<a href="/link-to-topic">Learn more about our accessibility efforts</a>` | clearly describes what the user will find if they click the link |
