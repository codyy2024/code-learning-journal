# Day 8: Build a Travel Agency Page
Not much to document - built a fake Travel Agency Page   
## A few things I didn't quite get it right:
1. Forgot where `meta` element lives & mixed `head` and `main` elements
2. Didn't realise you needed to separate and can have two+ `meta` elements   
What I did:
    ```
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" name="description" content="You Go-to Online Agency" />
    ```
3. Forgot about the `taget="_blank"` for anchor elements `a`
4. Don't quite fully understand the `figure` element still - it seems if we don't need `figcaption` then we don't neccessarily need this and can just use the `img` element?
   > One thing that came to my mind whilst writing the above: the `figure` element seems to be the equivalent of `ul`, just the `li` is incorprated into the `img` element. With them being `li`, they're indented. If we just use the `img` wuthout `figure`, then it will just render as non-indented content (like a paragraph), and you can't actually add `figcaption`.
   > Tested like so:   
     - With code like so without `figure`:   
       ```

       ```   
       Render:   
  <img width="386" height="575" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a36f284-0f75-43ab-ba55-379f6f7fc2f8" /> |
    - with `figure` render:   
      <img width="403" height="654" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea3c52f5-19f0-44f6-a4a1-b415e13161c1" />

## A few things I did do well
1. Boilerplate - up until now every time when it comes to a workshop or lab, I write the boilerplate first, then add more elements and other details
2. I got the anchor of images right
3. Can see a web page and think from a behind the scene / HTML POV

End result:
