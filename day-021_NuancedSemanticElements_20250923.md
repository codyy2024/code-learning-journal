# Day 21: Lecture - Understanding Nuanced Semantic Elements

Chit-chat: I'm nog going to complain about sleeplessness from now on. Becasue this is the new norm now ðŸ˜…

## Key topics covered: 
(I haven't been using the .md template I created as I ended up mostly creating from scratch anyway so had forgotten about this which I think is still good to keep)
- [x] emphasis `em` element vs. idiomatic `i` element
- [x] strong `strong` element vs. bring attention to element (which one is this - `bold`?)
- [x] description lists (this is new)

## 1. When to use emphasis `em` element vs. idiomatic `i` element
### 1.1 `i`
**Presentational** element that shows that it's somehow different from the surrounding text (e.g., highlighting alternative voice or mood, idiomatic terms from another language, technical terms, and thoughts)

Example:

```
<p>There is a certain <i lang="fr">je ne sais quoi</i> in the air.</p>
```
### 1.2 `em`
**Semantic** element to represent a special emphasis to <em>only</em> a few words compared to surrounding text

<ins>It's important to know that these elements should not be used for presentational purposes only. If you need to display the text in italics, but the text doesn't have a special purpose, style, or meaning in the paragraph, you should use CSS instead.</ins>   
> Don't quite understand what this <i>actually</i> means
