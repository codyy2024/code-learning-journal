# code-learning-journal
**My journey from a complete coding newbie to completing the Full Stack Developer Curriculum on freeCodeCamp.**

When I started this curriculum, I'm working as a CRM Campaign Manager at a Data & CRM technical consultancy agency, and working towards a more technical role **Technical Campaign Manager**.

During the 3 years here I gradually developed the interest in coding and generic technical stuff (e.g., Adobe Campaign workflows) - I found myself fascinated by the shear joy of **creating** something from void (well, sort of), and the excitement of documenting, maintaining and **fixing** things.

Previously I've learnt through freeCodeCamp's what's now called "legacy" courses - HTML course (given up half way through) and Python for Everybody (finished but never put into use so almost forgot about everything a week later).

I'm not a person with good self-discipline to be honest. I've migrated this learning journal from Notion to here following a fellow ex-colleague's suggestion (he was our Head of Data Engineer). By doing so, I'm hoping to "self discipline" on this curriculum and end somewhere more technical/code-y. Maybe CRM + MarTech Consultant/Solution Engineer, or a complete career path change to say Full Stack Developer or Software Engineer.

At the time of starting this journey, all sorts of coding AI are already fairly competent. But I don't think it's too late (I'm 38 btw), and I do think noone or no AI can take the shear joy of writing the code or configuring the high-level architecture of code writing from you.

Best wishes to myself, and to everyone who wants to code with no prior experience whatsoever like myself.

And thanks for getting me here - freeCodeCamp, Rob.
