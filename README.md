# code-learning-journal
My journey from a complete coding newbie to completing the Full Stack Developer Curriculum on freeCodeCamp.

When I started this curriculum, I'm working as a CRM Campaign Manager at a Data & CRM technical consultancy agency, and working towards a more technical role **Technical Campaign Manager**.

During the 3 years in here I gradually developed the interest in coding - I found myself fascinated by the shear joy of **creating** something from void, or the excitement of documenting, maintaining and **fixing** things.

Previously I've learnt through freeCodeCamp's what's now called "legacy" courses - HTML corouse (given up half way through) and Python for Everybody (finished but never put into use so almost forgot about everything a week later).

I'm not a person with good self-discipline to be honest, and migrated this learning journal from Notion to here following a fellow ex-colleague's suggestion (he was our Head of Data Engineer).

I'm hoping to "self-discipline" on this curriculum and end somewhere more technical/code-y. Maybe CRM + MarTech/Solution Engineer, or maybe a complete career path change to say Full Stack Developer or SOftware Engineer.

At the time of starting this journey, all sorts of AI are already fairly competent. But I don't think it's too late (I'm 38 btw with no prior coding experience), and I do think noone or no AI can take the shear joy of writing the code or configuring the high-level architecture of code writing.

Best wishes to myself, and to everyone who wanted to code with no experience whatsoever.

And thanks for getting me here - freeCodeCamp, Rob.
