# code-learning-journal
**WELCOME, to my journey from a complete coding newbie to completing the Full Stack Developer Curriculum by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/).**

Daily journal is updated [here](https://github.com/codyy2024/code-learning-journal).

When I started this curriculum, I'm working as a CRM Campaign Manager at a Data & CRM technical consultancy agency, and working towards a more technical role **Technical Campaign Manager**.

During the 3 years here I gradually developed the interest in generic technical stuff (e.g., Adobe Campaign workflows) and coding (computer language) - I found myself fascinated by the shear joy of **creating** something from void (well, sort of), and the excitement of documenting, maintaining and **fixing** things.

Previously I've learnt through freeCodeCamp's what's now called "legacy" courses - HTML course (given up half way through) and Python for Everybody (finished but never put into use so almost forgot about everything a week later).

If I'm being honest, I'm not a person with good self-discipline. Think of wher you had a week of hoping to upskill yourself - only to upskill yourself on how ot be fed by YouTube videos and some house admin/DIY ðŸ˜…. I migrated this learning journal from Notion to here following a fellow ex-colleague's suggestion (he was our Head of Data Engineer). By doing so, I'm hoping to "self discipline" on this curriculum and end somewhere more technical/code-y. Maybe CRM + MarTech Consultant or Solution Engineer/Architect, or a complete career path change to say Full Stack Developer or Software Engineer.

At the time of starting this journey, all sorts of coding AIs are already fairly competent. But I don't think it's too late (I'm 38 btw), and I do think no one or no AI can take the pure joy of writing the code, or configuring the high-level architecture of code writing from you in the AI world.

Best wishes to myself, and to everyone who wants to code with no prior experience whatsoever like myself.

And thanks for getting me here - my fellow colleagues, freeCodeCamp, and Rob.
