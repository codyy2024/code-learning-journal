## 1. When Is the alt Attribute Needed, and What Are Some Examples of Good Alt Text?
Alt text is used 1) in images and 2)by search engines to understand images.
## 1.1 Best practices of `alt` text for images:
+ You should try to keep alt text short but should still be detailed enough to understand the image, but not so long at the same time that it becomes confusing.
  > Example: this is too short - "A puppy", "Resort".
+ You should not try to describe every little detail. Focus on the most important aspects of the image.
+ Generally, you don't need to start with "image of" or "picture of." You can just start the description directly.
+ Also, if there's similar text around the image, you don't need to write it again.
+ It's usually recommended to end the alt text with a period for consistency.
+ If the image is a link to another page, instead of describing the image itself, the alt text should describe what will happen if users click on it.
  > Instead of
  > ```
  > <a href="about.html">
  >   <img src="arrow-right.png" alt="Right arrow." />
  > </a>
  > ```
  > It should be something like
  > ```
  > <a href="about.html">
  >   <img src="arrow-right.png" alt="Go to next page." />
  > </a>
  > ```
+ every image needs to have an alt text attribute - even if image is decorative, the `alt` attribute should be empty i.e. `alt=""`, you need to have the attribute present in your HTML code.
  - having it so it can be ignored by screen readers
  - not having it at all will result in screen readers reading the image file name
  > Example: `<img src="decorative_image.jpg" alt="" />`
