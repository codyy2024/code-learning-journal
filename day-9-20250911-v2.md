# Day 9: Lecture - Working with Audio and Video Elements   
> A confession to make: I have been thinking of how the curriculum is structured since day 1, but it's not until yesterday did it come to my mind that I might start jotting down things I think could be improved.
>
> And this starts today.
> 
> Oh btw I started a [journal template](https://github.com/codyy2024/code-learning-journal/blob/main/JOURNAL-TEMPLATE-%5Bday-x-yyyymmdd.md%5D.md) - before this I wrote the journal in .md from scratch every day. Whilst it did help me get familarised with the Markdown syntax and Github-specific quirks, it does have a lot of repetitive structure that can well be templated.

> Anyway, chit chat ends, learning continues.

Key learning points covered:   
- [x] the `audio` element (not void)  
- [x] the `video` element (not void)
- [x] the `controls`, `loop` and `muted` <sup>1</sup> attributes
- [x] the `poster` attribute - unique for `video` element (not applicable for `audio`)
- [x] the `source` element (void) within the `audio` or `video` elements
> <sup>1</sup> boolean attribute, i.e. no value assigned and it's either true or false)
---

## `audio`   
Add sound content to your HTML documents.
- Uses `src` attribute (similar to the `src` in `img` element (void)) BUT **not** void so has opening and closing tags
  - `<audio src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/js-music-player/can't-stay-down.mp3"></audio>`
  - seems no content between opening and closing tags? (tried to add and it just does nothing (not showing as content on the front end web page)
- Formats supported:
  - [.ogg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg)  
  - .mp4  
  - [.webm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebM)  
- Common attributes
  - `controls`: boolean attribute that can be added to an element to enable built-in playback controls. If omitted, no controls will be shown.
  - `loop`: boolean attribute that makes the audio/video replay continuously
  - `muted`: boolean attribute that makes the HTML start the audio/video in a muted state
  
  ```

  <audio controls loop muted>
      <source src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/js-music-player/can't-stay-down.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
      <source src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/js-music-player/can't-stay-down.wav" type="audio/wav" />
      <source src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/js-music-player/can't-stay-down.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
    </audio>

  ```

  > **Q**: any hierarchy of these three, i.e., result is the same no matter in what order these three appears?
- `source` element between the opening and closing tags 
  - Because there are differences in which browsers support which of the three formats
  
## `video`   
Add video content to your HTML documents.
- Uses `src` attribute (similar to `img`) BUT **not** void so has opening and closing tags
  - `<video src="https://archive.org/download/BigBuckBunny_124/Content/big_buck_bunny_720p_surround.mp4"></video>`
  - seems no content between opening and closing tags?
- Formats supported:
  - [.ogg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg)  
  - .mp3  
  - .wav  
- Common attributes
  - `controls`: boolean attribute that can be added to an element to enable built-in playback controls. If omitted, no controls will be shown.
  - `loop`: boolean attribute that makes the audio/video replay continuously
  - `muted`: boolean attribute that makes the HTML start the audio/video in a muted state
  - `poster`: display an image while the video is downloading
  - `width`: set the width to xxxx pixels so the video fits better on the screen
  
  ```
      <video
      src="https://archive.org/download/BigBuckBunny_124/Content/big_buck_bunny_720p_surround.mp4"
      loop
      controls
      muted
      poster="https://peach.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/title_anouncement.jpg?x11217"
      width="620"
    ></video>
    
  ```   
   > **Q**: any hierarchy of these three, i.e., result is the same no matter what order in which these three appears?
- `source` element between the opening and closing tags 
  - Because there are differences in which browsers support which of the three formats
